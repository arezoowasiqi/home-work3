            <p>Tom and Jerry is an American animated media franchise
                 and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by
                  William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Best known for 
                  its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series 
                  centers on the rivalry between the titular characters of a cat 
                  named Tom and a mouse named Jerry. Many shorts also feature several recurring characters.
                  In its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 Tom and Jerry
                  shorts for MGM from 1940 to 1958.[1] During this time,
                  they won seven Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film,
                  tying for first place with Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies 
                  with the most awards in the category. After the MGM cartoon 
                  studio closed in 1957, MGM revived the series with Gene 
                  Deitch directing an additional 13 Tom and Jerry shorts for 
                  Rembrandt Films from 1961 to 1962. Tom and Jerry became the 
                  highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, 
                  overtaking Looney Tunes. Chuck Jones produced another 34 
                  shorts with Sib Tower 12 Productions between 1963 and 1967. 
                  Five more shorts have been produced since 2001, making a 
                  total of 166 shorts. </p>

            <p>The Pink Panther is an American media franchise primarily focusing on 
                a series of comedy-mystery films featuring an inept French police detective, 
                Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The franchise began with the release of the film 
                The Pink Panther in 1963. The role of Clouseau was originated by and is most
                 closely associated with Peter Sellers. Most of the films were written and
                  directed by Blake Edwards, with theme music composed by Henry Mancini. 
                  Elements and characters inspired by the films were adapted into other media, 
                  including books, comic books, video games and animated series.  </p>
